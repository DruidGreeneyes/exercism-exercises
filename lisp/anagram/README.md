# Anagram

Write a program that, given a word and a list of possible anagrams, selects the correct sublist.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

for instructions to get started writing Common Lisp. That page will
explain how to install and setup a Lisp implementation and how to run
the tests.
